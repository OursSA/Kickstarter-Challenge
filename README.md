The objective is to identify what launch window and funding goal would contribute to the chances of a successful campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

[Chart of outcomes based on launch date](main/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)
In general, the greatest number of campaigns tended to launch in May and June. These were also the months with the highest success rate.
The rate of successful campaigns trends downward toward the autumn and winter months, with December launches seeming particularly unlikely to be successful.
The number of canceled campaigns remains quite low compared to those that are completed throughout the year, but there is a small uptick in canceled campaigns in January.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
